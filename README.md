One of the most challenging parts was figuring out the dimensions of the frame, because for certain height and width paramters, the text fields would collapse and be much harder to use. This was a persistent problem that had to be solved every time I tested the program after adding a new section in the GridBag. Another challenge was the scale of the code, as the Action Listener method was interacting with the information in the constructor and the main method in a way that I hadn't thought about before, so it was a conceptual challenge.
